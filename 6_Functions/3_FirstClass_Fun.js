// First Class and High Order Functions

/* 1. First Class Functions:
- JavaScript treats funcrions as first class citizens
- This means that functions are simply values
- Functions are just another "type" of object

ex: const add = function(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
 */

/* 2. High Order Functions
- A function that recieves another function as an argument,
 that returns a new functions, or both
- This is only because of first class functions 

ex: btn.addEventListener("click", greet)
*/
